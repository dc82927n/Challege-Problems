/*

You need to write a function that reverses the words in a given string. 
A word can also fit an empty string. If this is not clear enough, 
here are some examples:

As the input may have trailing spaces, you will also need to ignore
 unneccesary whitespace.*/

reverse('Hello World') === 'World Hello'
reverse('Hi There.') === 'There. Hi'


function reverse(string){
  //your code here

  // variable newString 
  let newString = ""

  // loop throught the string from the back to the front and rebuild the string
  for (let = string.length-1; i > 0; i--){
  	newString += string[i] // word => 
  }


  // return the string 

/*prompt the user to enter a name and prints it back with a new messsage*/
 
}
